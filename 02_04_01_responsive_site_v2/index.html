                    About Deconstruction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    "Deconstruction" is a form of criticism described by the philosopher Jacques Derrida in his book Of Grammatology, translated into English in 1976. The term has a broad cultural impact in the U.S. in the 1970s and 1980s, spreading from departments of literature to the fields of architecture, graphic design and fashion.

                    Deconstruction in Graphics Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In graphics design, Deconstruction is often associated with David Carson. David Carson was the art director for the magazine Ray Gun, in which he employed much of the typographic and layout approach for which he is known. In particular, his widely imitated aesthetic defined the so-called "grunge typography" era.

                    <h2>Punk visual art</h2>
                    <p>
                        Punk visual art is artwork associated with the punk subculture. It often graces punk rock album covers, flyers for punk concerts, punk zines and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.

                        The main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks album designed by Jamie Reid. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Los Angeles artist Mark Vallen has said:

                        Punk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers

                    <h2>Pop Art, Punk visual art and Deconstruction</h2>
                    <p>
                        The late 70´s Punk Music and Punk Visual Art served as an inspiration just as well as Jacques Derrida´s work. Album Covers like Sexpistols God Save The Queen, made by Jamie Reid 1977 looks almost like a blend of Warhols way of using Marylin Monroe mixed with a rough and cut up texture that later was refined by graphic artists like David Carson.

                    <h2>Jamie Reid</h2>
                    <p>
                        Jamie Reid (born 1947[1]) is an English artist and anarchist with connections to the Situationists. His work, featuring letters cut from newspaper headlines in the style of a ransom note, came close to defining the image of punk rock, particularly in the UK. His best known works include the Sex Pistols album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols and the singles "Anarchy in the UK", "God Save The Queen" (based on a Cecil Beaton photograph of Queen Elizabeth II, with an added safety pin through her nose and swastikas in her eyes

                            Reid's design for the Sex Pistols' "Anarchy in the U.K." poster—a ripped and safety-pinned Union Flag—is regarded as the pivotal work in establishing a distinctive punk visual aesthetic

                    <p>
                        Ray Gun explored experimental magazine typographic design and unique angles on the pop cultural currents of the 1990s. The editorial content was framed in a chaotic, abstract style, not always readable (it once published an interview with Bryan Ferry entirely in the symbol font Zapf Dingbats), but distinctive in appearance.[1] That visual tradition continued even after Carson left the magazine after three years; he was followed by a series of art directors, including Robert Hales, Chris Ashworth, Jason Saunby, Scott Denton-Cardew, and Jerome Curchod.
                    </p>

                    <h2>What was Ray Gun</h2>
                    <p>
                        In terms of content, Ray Gun was also notable for its choices of subject matter. The advertising, musical artists and pop culture icons spotlighted were progressive

                        Ray Gun produced over 70 issues from 1992 through 2000. Owner-founder-publisher Marvin Scott Jarrett (one-time publisher of a late-1980s incarnation of Creem) also created the magazines Stick, huH [2], Bikini [3], and Nylon [4], a New York–based fashion magazine.[5] The most notable common thread among all of Jarrett's magazines (from his latter-day Creem through Nylon) has been their graphic design.

                    As demonstrated in these pictures, typography tends to be used more as a texture or graphical effect. Almost as the buildings by Frank Gehry, the text swirls and curls to become a piece of graphic art by itself
